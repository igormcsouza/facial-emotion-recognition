# Facial Emotion Recognition

Hey there! Image recognition is really my thing these days, but I noticed I have almost none
image recognition related repositories, all my work on that was on private repositories, so
I decided to add one more project so I can play around with keras and also deploy it on a 
DevOps mood.

## Project Summary

### Database

The database I'm using may be found [here](https://github.com/muxspace/facial_expressions). 
I made some changes so it can be suitable using Keras. The script to transform will be
found on the [research](research/) folder.
